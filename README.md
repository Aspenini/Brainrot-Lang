# 🧠💀 Brainrot Lang (BRL) 💀🧠

A meme-first scripting language with emoji operators and Gen Z slang!

## Features

- **Emoji operators**: 💀 (add), 😭 (subtract), 🔥 (multiply), 🗿 (divide), 📉 (mod), 🙏 (power)
- **Brainrot keywords**: RIZZ, SKIBIDI, GYATT, FANUMTAX, and more!
- **7 Global braincells**: sigma, gyatt, skull, npc, goon, fanum, aura
- **Variable decay**: Each variable can only be used 3 times before becoming "cooked"
- **Gaslighting**: Every 3rd print becomes aLiTeRnAtInG cAsE
- **Execution modes**: DEV ENERGY, NO CAP, DEBUG MODE, HYPERSKOOM
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS support

## Installation

Just run the interpreter with Python 3:

```bash
python brainrot.py your_program.brainrot
```

## Example Program

```brainrot
💀💀💀
DEV ENERGY
NO CAP
FANUMTAX sigma = 42
GYATT "Hello, Brainrot World!"
GYATT sigma
💀💀💀
```

## Documentation

See `docs/index.html` for the complete language specification.

## Current Status

✅ **Working Features:**
- Lexer/Tokenizer
- Parser with AST generation
- Interpreter with 7 braincells
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Print statements (GYATT)
- Execution modes (DEV ENERGY, NO CAP)
- Variable decay system
- Gaslighting (alternating case prints)
- Error handling with "YOU FELL OFF"

🚧 **In Progress:**
- Binary operations with emoji operators
- Control flow (RIZZ/SKIBIDI)
- Built-in functions
- Graphics and I/O

## Contributing

This is a meme language, but contributions are welcome! The interpreter is built in Python with a clean architecture:

- `interpreter.py` - Main interpreter with lexer, parser, and executor
- `brainrot.py` - Command-line interface
