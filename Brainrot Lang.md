# Brainrot Lang

**Brainrot Lang** is a programming language aimed at using only/mostly brainrot terms!

```brainrot
LOCK IN
FANUMTAX rizz FR "wsg"
FANUMTAX goon FR "WORLD!"
FANUMTAX sigma FR rizz 💀 goon
SAY sigma
ITS OVER
```

---

## Program Structure
Programs must start with `LOCK IN` and end with `ITS OVER`.

```brainrot
LOCK IN
🖕 ...code
ITS OVER
```

---

## Comments
Rather than the typical `#`, comments are written with `🖕`.

```brainrot
🖕 this is a comment! this code sucks
```

---

## Math
Mathematical symbols are replaced with emojis/terms:  

- `💀 = +`  
- `😭 = -`  
- `😏 = ×`  
- `🚡 = ÷`  
- `FR = =`  

---

## Braincells
Data can be stored in any of the 7 braincells:  

- `rizz`  
- `aura`  
- `peak`  
- `goon`  
- `mog`  
- `npc`  
- `sigma`  

Example:  

```brainrot
FANUMTAX peak FR 2
```

---

## I/O
`SAY` will print values.  

```brainrot
FANUMTAX goon FR 69
SAY goon
/// 69
```

---

## Data and Copy
- `FANUMTAX` declares/assigns a value to a braincell.  
- `DIDDLE` copies the value from one
