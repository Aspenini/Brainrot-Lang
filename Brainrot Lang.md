# Brainrot Lang
**Brainrot Lang** is a programming language aimed at using only/mostly brainrot terms!
```LOCK IN
FANUMTAX rizz FR "wsg"
FANUMTAX goon FR "WORLD!"
FANUMTAX sigma FR rizz 💀 goon
SAY sigma
ITS OVER```

## Program Structure
Programs must start with `LOCK IN` and end with `ITS OVER`
```LOCK IN
🖕...code
ITS OVER```

## Comments
Rather than the typical `#` comments are commented out with `🖕`
```🖕this is a comment! this code sucks```

## Math
Mathematical symbols are replaced by certain emojis and terms
`💀 = +`
`😭 = -`
`😏 = x`
`🚡 = /`
`FR = =`

## Braincells
Data can be stored in any of the 7 braincells:
`rizz`
`aura`
`peak`
`goon`
`mog`
`npc`
`sigma`

```FANUMTAX peak FR 2```

## I/O
`SAY` will print
```FANUMTAX goon FR 69
SAY goon
69```

## Data and Copy
`FANUMTAX` declares/assigns a value to a braincell, while `DIDDLE` can copy the value from one braincell to another
